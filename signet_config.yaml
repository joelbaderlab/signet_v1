#Extracting SNP locations from Ensembl:
#first extract gwasrows given pubid - save as "phenotype_GWAScat.txt", in data dir
#then, extract the rsid lists:
#utils_data.GWAScat_rows(phenotype_list, GWAS_dir, project_datadir)
#output saved as "phenotype + _GWAScat_rsid.txt" in data/GWAS_catalogue
#next, upload this list/file to ensembl to download location file
#Make sure to use GRCh38.p13 version and under Filters {Variant source: sbSNP, Variant name: choose file}
#name downloaded location file as "phenotype_GWAScat_rsid_GRCh38p13.txt", MAKE sure tsv! save in data dir
