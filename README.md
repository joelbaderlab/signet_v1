SigNet (Significance Networks): Prioritization of causal genes from GWAS using within-locus and between-locus information

## Installation

We like to have a top-level directory with sub-directories for the github repo, for external data (GWAS data, colocalization data, interaction data, genome reference), and for results. So, somewhere in your path, create a top-level directory called `signet` and then
```
cd signet
git clone https://github.com/joelbaderlab/signet_v1.git
mkdir DATA
mkdir RESULTS
```
